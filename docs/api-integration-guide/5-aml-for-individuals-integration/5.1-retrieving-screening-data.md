# 5.1 Retrieving Screening Data

You will receive a webhook with type **screening.aml.completed** indicating that the scan has been completed.

During and after the screening process ends, you will receive **webhooks** (HTTP POST requests) to the webhook callback URL you provide to the GlobalPass support team. When receiving these requests, ensure that the body value of "secret" matches the webhook secret we will provide.

```js title="Example webhook"
{
    "type": "screening.aml.completed",
    "data": {
        "screeningToken": "f4564d3d-69de-4093-971d-796699c0e8c5"
    },
    "secret": "secret"
}
```

To get screenings status, make an HTTP GET request to:

_/api/v2/screenings/{screeningToken}/status_

```bash title="Example request"
curl --location --request GET 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings/f4564d3d-69de-4093-971d-796699c0e8c5/status' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```


```js title="Example response #1"
{
    "status": "Accepted"
}
```

```js title="Example response #2"
{
    "status": "Rejected"
}
```

> Possible **status** values:
- Accepted – screening is completed, AML matches over your set-up threshold **are not** found.
- Rejected – screening is completed, AML matches over your set-up threshold **are** found.

To retrieve **AML scan results** from a completed screening, make an HTTP GET request to:

_/api/v2/screenings/{screeningToken}/aml/matches_

```bash title="Example request"
curl --location --request GET 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings/9519c730-5d6e-4c23-b89a-8c4d06899e7f/aml/matches' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```
