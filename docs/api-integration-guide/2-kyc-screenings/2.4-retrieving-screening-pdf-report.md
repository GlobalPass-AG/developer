# 2.4 Retrieving Screening PDF Report

To retrieve a latest PDF report of the screening, make an HTTP GET request to

_/api/v2/screenings/{screeningToken}/report_

```bash title="Example request"
curl --location --request GET 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings/1i0404b1-0fe9-4i9a-805c-f41e78de1d0e/report' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```

```text title="Example response"
Response returns the PDF file.
```

If latest PDF report does not contain some additional data (such as compliance comment left on the report after the screening was completed), you can trigger generation of a new PDF report. To do so, make an HTTP POST request to:

_/api/v2/screenings/{screeningToken}/report_

```bash title="Example request"
curl --location --request POST 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings/1i0404b1-0fe9-4i9a-805c-f41e78de1d0e/report' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```

API returns the report ID of the newly requested PDF report.
 Operation is asynchronous, response code is 202 (Accepted):

```js title="Example response"
{
    "reportId": "30f61d2d-f0f8-4f3b-92f5-4ba4e3c05516"
}
```

To retrieve the updated report, allow the system up to 20 seconds to generate a new PDF and simply make a new request to retrieve the latest PDF report of the screening token like in the instructions above.

Report ID value allows you to retrieve any specific historical PDF report of a screening. To get a list of all available historical screening reports, make an HTTP GET request to

_/api/v2/screenings/{screeningToken}/report/history_

```bash title="Example request"
curl --location --request GET 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings/1i0404b1-0fe9-4i9a-805c-f41e78de1d0e/report/history' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```

Response returns report IDs of all available PDF reports for retrieving, with timestamps when they were created:

```js title="Example response"
[
    {
        "reportCreatedAt": "2022-12-20T09:22:27.188Z",
        "reportId": "30f61d2d-f0f8-4f3b-92f5-4ba4e3c05516"
    },
    {
        "reportCreatedAt": "2022-12-20T09:06:57.653Z",
        "reportId": "5856cc18-59b5-4716-972d-5eeeefa0bfd0"
    }
]
```

To retrieve a specific historical PDF report, make an HTTP GET request to

_/api/v2/screenings/{screeningToken}/report/{reportId}_

```bash title="Example request"
curl --location --request GET 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings/1i0404b1-0fe9-4i9a-805c-f41e78de1d0e/report/5856cc18-59b5-4716-972d-5eeeefa0bfd0' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```
