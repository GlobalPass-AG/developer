# Initiating a KYC Screening

#### Swagger docs

[https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/swagger](https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/swagger)

#### Screening API endpoints

- [https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch](https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/) (_sandbox_)
- [https://screenings-api.globalpass.ch](https://screenings-api.globalpass.ch/) (_production_)

#### Retrieving screening token

To initiate a user screening, first create a **screening token** by making an HTTP POST request to:

_/api/v2/screenings_

```bash title="Request"
curl --location --request POST 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/screenings' --header 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}'
```

```js title="Response"
{"token": "bf42e9f1-9af8-4a6b-a1fd-9440f1fe9bfd"}
```

:::caution IMPORTANT
For each unique user account in your system, you should issue and keep only **one screening token** - treat it as each user's **unique GlobalPass Screening ID**. Therefore, when propmpting user to repeat a widget session, or when initializing identity and address screening modes of the same unique user, make sure to provide the same unique screening token issued for the unique user.
:::

#### Initiating GlobalPass Widget

After getting the screening token, provide it to our javascript widget that you have pasted into your frontend.

##### Widget source URLs:

- [https://cdn.globalpass.ch/stage/global-pass-screening-widget.latest.js](https://cdn.globalpass.ch/stage/global-pass-screening-widget.latest.js) (_sandbox_)
- [https://cdn.globalpass.ch/live/global-pass-screening-widget.latest.js](https://cdn.globalpass.ch/live/global-pass-screening-widget.latest.js) (_production_)

Your page should look something like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://cdn.globalpass.ch/stage/global-pass-screening-widget.latest.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="widgetScreening"></div>
    <script>
      GPScreeningWidget.init({
        elementId: "widgetScreening",
        token: "bf42e9f1-9af8-4a6b-a1fd-9440f1fe9bfd",
        redirectUri: "https://your-redirect-uri.com/",
        externalId: "your-customer-ID",
        mode: "Identity",
        language: "en"
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

:::note
Specifying mode is required if you wish to use _Split Flow_ approach. If _Regular Flow_ is used â€“ do not specify mode. Before starting integration, contact GlobalPass support to find out more about the differences and inform which approach you wish to use, as appropriate set-up on GlobalPass end will be required as well.
