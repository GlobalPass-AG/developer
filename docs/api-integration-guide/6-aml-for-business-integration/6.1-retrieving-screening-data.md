# 6.1 Retrieving Screening Data

You will receive a webhook with type **business.change** whenever the screening status changes.

```js title="Example webhook"
{
    "type": "business.change",
    "data": {
        "screeningToken": "f4564d3d-69de-4093-971d-796699c0e8c5"
    },
    "secret": "secret"
}
```

After receiving this webhook, you can get screening status by making an HTTP GET request to:

_api/v2/business/{screeningToken}_

```bash title="Example request"
curl -X 'GET' 'https://screenings-api-test.globalpass.ch/api/v2/business/f4564d3d-69de-4093-971d-796699c0e8c5' -H 'accept: text/plain' -H 'Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token} '
```

```js title="Example response"
{
    "name": "Apple",
    "taxRegistrationNumber": "0000320193",
    "country": "United States",
    "status": "Accepted"
}
```

> Possible **status** values:
- Accepted – screening is completed, AML matches over your set-up threshold **are not** found.
- Rejected – screening is completed, AML matches over your set-up threshold **are** found.
