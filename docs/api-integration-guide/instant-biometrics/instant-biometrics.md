All backend API calls should be executed sending _access\_token_ in requests header received in the [Authentication](#_Authentication)step.

To **initiate** instant biometrics process, make an HTTP POST request to:

_/api/v2/instant-biometrics_

- Instant biometrics are allowed only for already Accepted or Rejected ConditionsNotMet KYC screenings
- It's possible to provide instant biometrics check timeout in minutes before it expires in GlobalPass in case user abandons the process

To **fetch** instant biometric details, make an HTTP GET request to:

_/api/v2/instant-biometrics/{instantBiometricsId}_

To **cancel** initiated instant biometric process, make an HTTP POST request to:

_/api/v2/instant-biometrics/{instantBiometricsId}/cancel_

> Possible **status** values:
- Initiated - Process initiated. Waiting for user actions,
- Cancelled - Process was cancelled over API by 3rd party system,
- Expired - User did not go through the process and after timeout screening was set as expired,
- Processing - User went through the process. GlobalPass is executing biometric match,
- Accepted - Biometrics verification ended successfully,
- Rejected - Biometrics verification ended not successfully

**Frontend**

The preferred method for user instant biometric check using GlobalPass widget:

- Add an HTML div element with your preferred HTML element id.
- Load the provided js file before calling the widget's init function.

Example:

```js
GPScreeningWidget.init({
    elementId: 'widget_div_id',
    instantBiometricsId: 'screening_token',
    onComplete: () => { alert('done'); },
    mode: 'InstantBiometrics'
});
```

This will load and render a working GlobalPass instant biometric check web widget that will be sending collected data directly to the GlobalPass back-end.

A callback function can be passed to execute javascript upon widget completion.
